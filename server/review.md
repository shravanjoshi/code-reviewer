❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
async function sum(){ return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function `sum` is declared as `async` but doesn't use `await`.  If there's no asynchronous operation, it shouldn't be marked `async`.
*   ❌ The function relies on variables `a` and `b` being in scope, but it doesn't declare or receive them as parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
*   ❌ Missing error handling.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    throw new TypeError('Arguments must be numbers.');
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔️  The `async` keyword is removed as it's unnecessary.
*   ✔️  The function now explicitly takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making its behavior predictable and reusable.
*   ✔️  Added type checking to ensure that only numbers are passed to the function.
*   ✔️  Includes error handling to prevent unexpected behavior if non-numbers are passed as arguments.

Final Note:

Ensure your functions explicitly declare their dependencies (parameters) and avoid relying on variables from the outer scope to prevent unexpected behavior.  Use `async` only when necessary for asynchronous operations. Always consider error handling to make your code more robust.
